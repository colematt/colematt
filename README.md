### Hi there 👋

- 👨🏻‍💻 I’m currently working at the [Binghamton Security Lab](https://github.com/bingseclab) as a PhD candidate in Computer Science.
- 👨🏻‍🏫 I teach [CS 580U: Programming Systems and Tools](https://github.com/bucs580u) at [Binghamton University](https://binghamton.edu/CS). I've taught CS 480/580T: Software Security and CS 458/558: Introduction to Computer Security.
- 🙋‍♂️🙋‍♀️ Ask me about systems programming, compiler design, or my corgis.
- 📚 [Read my publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GfQ-ozgAAAAJ&hl=en) (_but not while operating heavy machinery!_)
- 💬 My pronouns are he/him (en.US) and il/lui (fr.CA)
- Fun fact: Rolling Stone magazine once referred to me as a ["genius, patriot, ... and outright maniac"](https://web.archive.org/web/20100713001831/http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/17390/119236?RS_show_page=0) (_pick two out of three!_).
